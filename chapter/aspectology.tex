Aspect is one of the most studied areas of linguistics \citep{Sasse2002RecentAI}, particularly Slavic linguistics (for reasons I will discuss later), and hence a thorough theoretical discussion of the linguistic phenomenon which does full justice to the work on the field is not possible within the constraints of this thesis. Nevertheless, in order to make a productive contribution to the area I will touch on some of the main findings in the area of aspectology.
\section{A (short) phenomenology of aspect}
The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics \citep{matthews2014concise} defines aspect thus: 

\begin{quotation}
    General term, originally of specialists in Slavic languages, for verbal categories that distinguish the status of events, etc. in relation to specific periods of time, as opposed to their simple location in the present, past, or future.
\end{quotation}

As noted, one distinction which must be made right away is that between \emph{aspect}, and another temporal phenomenon \emph{tense}. Many works recall Bernard Comrie's differentiation in his book \emph{Aspect} \citep{comrie1976aspect} between the deictic nature of \emph{tense} and the focus on the "internal temporal constituency of a situation" of \emph{aspect}. In other words: "tense\footnote{In many of the world's languages this is grammaticalised as past, present and future; in others such as English by some accounts \citep{jespersen2013essentials} it is a binary distinction such as past and non-past, whereas Some languages such as Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) which some linguists have even argued to be tenseless \citet{10.1093/jos/ffh029}. See also the contentious debate about Hopi time \citet{whorf-writings, hopitime}. } relates the time of the situation referred to to some other time, usually to the moment of speaking", and thus by relating the time of the situation to the time of the utterance it is deictic \citep{comrie1976aspect}. Aspect on the other hand gives a \emph{situation-internal} description of the events in that situation, such how they relate to each other temporally or how an individual event is temporally characterised. This brings us to another important distinction: that between lexical and grammatical aspect.

\subsection{Lexical vs grammatical aspect}
The polysemy of the term “aspect” in the linguistic community is unfortunate. In an area of language which seems to have surprisingly far-reaching interactions with other parts of linguistic systems these ambiguities are particularly unhelpful.\footnote{Among other things, aspect is also intertwined with case, mood and voice \citep{franks2005slavic, Kiparsky2004PartitiveCA}.}
As already mentioned, aspect\footnote{Boogaart uses the term \emph{aspectuality} to remove the aforementioned ambiguity \citep{Boogaart+2004+1165+1180}. However, I will stick with the term \emph{aspect} due to its prevalence in the literature, further specifying where necessary.} is a term often used to refer to both lexical and grammatical aspect. Lexical aspect (also referred to as \emph{Aktionsart, situation aspect} or \emph{inner aspect}) is the inherent property of a verb or verb phrase which “characterizes the temporal profile of event descriptions” \citep{10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199601264.013.25}. For example, to “crack open an egg” is inherently a short event describing the change of one state (the egg being whole) to another (the egg being cracked). Grammatical aspect (or \emph{viewpoint aspect, outer aspect}), on the other hand, describes the “internal temporal constituency” \citep{comrie1976aspect} XCHANGE THIS!! of an event, such as its habituality or ongoing nature and can be seen more as an external lens imposed on a verbal phrase. In English, one example of this lens is the progressive, which is formed by the verb \emph{be} + gerund, as in the phrase “Sue was running”. Figure \ref{fig:TimeSitEvent} shows a taxonomy of tense, and grammatical and lexical aspect.

The concrete linguistic realisation of these categories is very often unclear or non-existent and exhibits a relatively wide variety of encodings throughout the world’s languages \citep{Dahl1985TenseAA}. It therefore proves tricky to uphold this distinction in empirical studies "in the real world". This has led some to question to what extent this distinction makes sense \citep{Sasse2002RecentAI}. Those who question the contrast between these two semantic dimensions, described as unidimensionalists in \citet{Sasse2002RecentAI}, claim that aspectual distinctions in both dimensions can be reduced to a common set of semantic primitives, which can be applied to all levels of analysis, i.e. the boundedness of lexical aspect is the same as the boundedness which marks the distinction between the perfective and imperfective parameters. 

I have chosen to introduce this distinction in order to WHAT

WHICH MODEL WOULD I LIKE TO USE IN THE END??

Nevertheless the theoretical differentiation of these two interrelated subdomains is an important one to make, and each describes a variety of concepts which will be useful later.

\subsection{Lexical aspect}
\subsection*{Telicity}
A fundamental distinction of lexical aspect is that of telicity (from Ancient Greek \emph{télos} meaning “end”). Telicity describes whether an event has an inherent goal or end-point after which the event can be regarded as completed: for example "go climbing" would be atelic whereas "climb the mountain" is telic (since it involves the agent reaching the summit of a mountain). A classic test for telicity\footnote{Though \citet{XiaoMcenery+2006+1+21} note that this test is flawed and propose an alternative test scheme.} is whether the verb phrase admits a completing adverb such as "in an hour" and does not admit a durative adverb such as "for an hour" \citep{Krifka1998TheOO}.

Dahl misleadingly defines telicity as "involv[ing] the presence of a boundary or the attainment of a specific result-state" \citep{DAHL2015210}, which, however can lead to confusion with the term \emph{(un)boundedness}.
\subsection*{Boundedness}
(Un)boundedness refers to the existance (or lack of) a \emph{temporal} boundary marking the end of an action. Boundedness must be distinguished from telicity\footnote{\citet{friedrich-etal-2023-kind} seem to mistakenly conflate the two, stating that "[t]elicity is also sometimes referred to as boundedness (e.g., by Loáiciga and Grisot, 2016)" referring to the 2016 paper \citet{loaiciga-grisot-2016-predicting}, which, however, clearly distinguishes between the two notions.} in order to avoid the so-called 'Imperfective Paradox' highlighted by \citet{Linguistics2005DowtyD1}, here verbalised by \citet{zucchi}:

\begin{quotation}
    How is it possible that a statement of the form \emph{x was F-ing} is true and yet there
    is no time at which \emph{x was F-ed} is true?
\end{quotation}
More concretely, it asks the question why (\ref{para1}) entails (\ref{para2}) but (\ref{para3}) doesn't entail (\ref{para4}) in the examples below:
\begin{exe}
    \ex The man was running.
    \label{para1}
    \ex The man ran.
    \label{para2}
    \ex The man was building a house.
    \label{para3}
    \ex The man built a house.
    \label{para4}
\end{exe}
\citet{6608d9d0-a477-39af-8491-2172df5ae612} shows that this apparent "paradox" can be resolved by distinguishing between these two concepts of telicity and boundedness,\footnote{By definition of telicity as whether an even has an inherent end-point, and boundedness as whether it has a temporal boundary (separate from its intended end-point) we can distinguish between whether an event has reached its termination or whether it was ended before reaching this end-point. Therefore while it the case that the both (\ref{para1}) and (\ref{para2}) are bounded, only (\ref{para3}) and (\ref{para4}) contain telic events, and it seems to be the case that the progressive's focus on temporal boundary nullifies the end-point inherent in the verb phrase "build a house". This serves as an interesting example of the interaction between grammatical and lexical aspect.} and this further serves to show the dangers of misuse of terminology. Table \ref{table:runreftime} visualises the relationship between the reference time (temporal boundaries) and the run-time (the inherent "time schema" of the verb phrase). This allows for a clearer definition of boundedness, namely whether the right-hand side of the run-time boundary lies within the reference time or not (IS THIS TRUE?).

\end{table}
\label{table:runreftime}

\subsection*{Stativity}
Another parameter of lexical aspect I would like to discuss is stativity, which describes a state of being such as "know", "love" or "be", rather than an action \citep{binnick1991time}. A classic test for stativity in English is non-admittance of the progressive or the imperative \citep{McINTOSH+1975+35+42}.\footnote{Interestingly, however, \citet{Granath_Wherrity_2013} find that, assuming a functional-semantic definition if stativity, the usage of stative verbs with the progressive is much higher in spoken language, than in written language.} Consider the following examples:
\begin{exe}
    \ex[]{She ressembles her grandmother.}
    \ex[*]{She is ressembling her grandmother.}
\end{exe}
\subsection*{Durativity}
Durativity denotes whether an event takes time (i.e. has duration) or happens in an instant, and this can be checked in English by the compatability of durative adverbs such as \emph{for an hour} \citep{102998}. For example:
\begin{exe}
    \ex[]{Andrea was painting a picture for an hour.}
    \ex[*]{Andrea was reaching the summit for an hour.}
\end{exe}
\subsubsection{Some attempts at event classification}
\subsection*{\citet{vendler57}}
It was the seminal work \emph{Verbs and Times} \citep{vendler57} of philosopher Zeno Vender which initiated the discussion on inner aspect in the linguistic tradition.\footnote{A similar classification was also developed independently by Anthony Kenny in \emph{Action, Emotion and Will} \citep{Kenny1963-KENAEA}, however combining Achievement and Accomplishment into one single class \citep{19c36731-bdec-362e-9f45-1aaba76109d7}. Hence it is sometimes referred to as the Vendler-Kenny scheme of verb-types.} Vendler begins his discussion with the following premise:

\begin{displayquote}
    Indeed, as I intend to show, if we focus our attention primarily upon the time schemata presupposed by various verbs, we are able to throw light on some of the obscurities which still remain in these matters. [...] There are a few such schemata of very wide application. Once they have been discovered in some typical examples, they may be used as models of comparison in exploring and clarifying the behavious of any verb whatever.\footnote{\citet{vendler57}}
\end{displayquote}
That is to say, the "time schema" of any verb can be described through comparison with a set of prototypical classes (see \ref{table:vendlerverbs}), which can be easily identified. In order to arrive at these prototypical "schemata" he uses an analytical method consisting of classifying verbs according to their behaviour regarding certain elements of English grammar, as was also used to outline the aspectual parameters above.\footnote{The issue of Anglocentrism is one which has plagued many a linguistic theory throughout the years, with work from Chomsky's generative grammar \citep{LEVISEN2019101173} to Abstract Meaning Representation \citep{damonte2018crosslingual} being criticised for their too heavy focus on English.} For example, the first distinction he makes is between English verbs that permit the progressive and those that don't. This signals the first class of events known as 'states'. The article then goes on to outline the other three Vendlerian classes \emph{activity, accomplishment} and \emph{achievement}, and their character is summarised thus: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State} - non-dynamic, static and durative situation
    \item \textbf{Activity} - open-ended, dynamic and durative processes without an end-point
    \item \textbf{Accomplishment} - dynamic and durative processes with a natural end-point
    \item \textbf{Achievement} - instantaneous or near-instantaneous events (such as semelfactives)
\end{itemize}

Or to use the parameters of lexical aspect introduced above:
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
        \hline
                                & Static & Durative & Telic \\ \hline
        \textbf{State}          & +      & +        & - \\ \hline
        \textbf{Activity}       & -      & +        & - \\ \hline
        \textbf{Accomplishment} & -      & +        & + \\ \hline
        \textbf{Achievement}    & -      & -        & + \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Classification of Vendlerian event types by binary aspectual parameters \citep{Smith1991ThePO}.}
\end{table}

Vendler states in his introduction that verbs "presuppose" certain time schemata and hence assigns a category to each verb (as in \ref{table:vendlerverbs}). However it must also be stated that the true profile of a verb phrase such as those listed in \ref{table:vendlerverbs} depends heavily on the context. Hence a typical semelfactive such as "sneeze" could also be used reinterpreted as a process when combined with a progressive auxiliary as in "Harry was sneezing" \citep{moens-steedman-1988-temporal}. Thus the verbs (or verb phrases) mentioned by Vendler as belonging to a certain category are ones that typically lend themselves to one class or another.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        
        \textbf{State} & \textbf{Activity} & \textbf{Accomplishment} & \textbf{Achievement} \\
        know & running & paint a picture & reach the summit \\
        understand & pushing & build a house & spot the plane \\
        love & smoking & deliver a sermon & recognise
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Some of the example verb phrases given in \citet{vendler57} for the classification of events.}
\end{table}
\label{table:vendlerverbs}

\subsection{Grammatical aspect}
Grammatical (or \emph{viewpoint}) aspect provides a lens through which a particular event is viewed and it "is typically expressed by overt grammatical morphemes (hence the label grammatical aspect)" \citep{Chapter1IntroductionCrossLinguisticPerspectivesontheSemanticsofGrammaticalAspect}. \citet{comrie1976aspect} provides a hierarchical classification of aspectual oppositions shown in \ref{fig:comrieaspecttree}, and in the following section I will look at some of the main oppositions described in this classification.

\subsection*{Perfective vs. Imperfective}
The main aspectual distinction made by Slavic languages and, as can bee seen in figure \ref{fig:comrieaspecttree}, one of the main distinctions made in theoretical aspectology generally as that between perfective and imperfective. In order to avoid confusion with the concrete realisation of these theoretical categories in the aforementioned Slavic group I will follow the nomenclature used by DAHLL and refer to the theoretical

\section{Aspectual ambiguity}
While some verb phrases can only express one certain aspect, such as \emph{to tend to}, which implies a habitual event, in many situations they can be ambiguous:
\begin{exe}
    \ex Your soul was made to be \textbf{filled} with God Himself. \emph{(Brown corpus, cited by \citet{Friedrich2014AutomaticPO})}
\end{exe}
In this example the verb 'filled' can be read as both a stative and a dynamic event.\footnote{Indeed, while not specified in English, this is explicitly encoded in other languages such as German where the former interpretation would use the word \emph{sein} (to be) and the latter \emph{werden} (to become).} Nevertheless, the reader tends to 

This poses a practical problem for annotators, but also an interesting theoretical question for linguists. 

There have been no studies on aspect ambiguity as of yet \citep{friedrich-etal-2023-kind}, despite this being a key feature of aspect systems in practice. 

For simplicity, most studies have assumed that 

\subsection{Coercion or underspecification?}
In cases where a verb can have several aspect readings depending on the context, a question that currently remains unclear is whether verbs have an inherent aspect class, which is \emph{overwritten} by the features of the context is occurs in (temporal adverbs, other verb phrases forcing a particular class such as \emph{to tend to} etc.), or whether they are simply underspecified in the mental lexicon, and the class is \emph{determined} by these circumstantial features \citep{https://doi.org/10.11588/huplc.2017.0.37820}. The former view, as put forward by \citet{moens-steedman-1988-temporal} and known as \emph{coercion}, is used as an assumption in many previous works (cf. \citet{Swart+2019+321+349}) with little evidence of its validity \citep{https://doi.org/10.11588/huplc.2017.0.37820}.

\section{Aspect in Slavic languages}
The Slavic language group has a special place on the study of aspectology due to its overt encoding of aspectual phenomena, otherwise rather uncommon \citep{slavstyleaspect}.\footnote{\citet{slavstyleaspect} also notes that Georgian and Ossetian exhibit some similar properties with preverbs (mostly of spatial origin) used to denote aspectual meaning.}
